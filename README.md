Code for generate the spatiotemporal dataset of dengue influencing factors in Brazil based on geospatial big data cloud computing

The GDP dataset reflects economic activity on an annual scale (e.g., infrastructure investment, industrial output). Building surface area as a proxy for urbanization is a slowly changing factor. 
The data generated by the code for GDP and building surface area are on an epidemiological time scale simply to be consistent with the other variables in terms of temporal and spatial scales.
